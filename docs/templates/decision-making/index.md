# Decision-Making Templates

Templates for documenting important decisions, particularly Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).

## Available Templates

- [Architecture Decision Record (ADR) Template](./adr-template.md) - For documenting architectural decisions
- [Technical Decision Template](./technical-decision-template.md) - For technical decisions
- [Product Decision Template](./product-decision-template.md) - For product-related decisions
- [Process Decision Template](./process-decision-template.md) - For process and workflow decisions

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Create an ADR

Create an Architecture Decision Record when:
- Making a significant architectural choice
- Choosing between multiple viable options
- Setting a precedent for future decisions
- Documenting a decision that affects multiple teams

### ADR Best Practices

- **Be Clear**: State the decision clearly
- **Provide Context**: Explain why the decision was needed
- **Document Alternatives**: List options that were considered
- **Explain Rationale**: Why was this option chosen?
- **Include Consequences**: What are the implications?
- **Keep Updated**: Update ADRs if decisions change

### ADR Numbering

Use a consistent numbering scheme:
- `ADR-001`, `ADR-002`, etc. (sequential)
- Or `ADR-YYYY-MM-DD-001` (date-based)

## Decision Lifecycle

1. **Proposed**: Decision is being considered
2. **Accepted**: Decision has been made and approved
3. **Deprecated**: Decision has been superseded
4. **Superseded**: Replaced by another ADR
